1. check if a array is monotonic and return a bool
monotonic - the order of the elements is the same - either increasing or decreasing
2. Convert a binary tree to a circular linked list where the nodes are inorder. Return the left most leaf node as head of the list
This is a binary tree and not a BST. So values will not be sorted. 

Given a list of tasks, return the minimum number of cycles taken to execute them if N cooling period is needed between similar tasks. Ensure that the order of the tasks are maintained
