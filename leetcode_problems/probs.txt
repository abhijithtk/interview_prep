Implement a LRU cache - follow up - how do you ensure it works in multi threaded cases
Given a list of tasks, return the minimum number of cycles taken to execute them if N cooling period is needed between similar tasks. Ensure that the order of the tasks are maintained
design a online chess game service
1. check if a array is monotonic and return a bool
monotonic - the order of the elements is the same - either increasing or decreasing
2. Convert a binary tree to a circular linked list where the nodes are inorder. Return the left most leaf node as head of the list
This is a binary tree and not a BST. So values will not be sorted.
